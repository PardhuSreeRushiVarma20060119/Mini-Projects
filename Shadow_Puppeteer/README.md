# Shadow Puppeteer — Adversarial Anti-Fingerprinting Injector

A small research-grade prototype that injects tiny adversarial perturbations into browser fingerprinting APIs (Canvas, WebGL, Audio) via a Playwright Python harness and measures fingerprint differences before/after. Useful as a privacy-defense experiment and starting point for more advanced research.

---

## What this repo contains
- **`anti_fingerprint.js`** — JS code injected into pages to perturb canvas/WebGL/audio outputs.  
- **`shadow_puppeteer.py`** — Playwright Python harness: collects fingerprint snapshot before/after injection and saves JSON.  
- **`evaluate.py`** — Simple evaluator that computes similarity metrics (`canvas_sim`, `gpu_sim`, `composite`).  
- **`testsite.html`** — Tiny test page to run locally.  
- **`requirements.txt`** — Python dependencies.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Create & activate a Python virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. **Install dependencies and Playwright browsers:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

3. **Serve the test page and run the harness:**
```bash
# From project root where sample_local_test.html exists
python -m http.server 8000

# In another terminal:
python shadow_puppeteer.py --target http://localhost:8000/testsite.html --out snaps.json
python evaluate.py snaps.json
```

You should see `snaps.json` created and `evaluate.py` will print similarity metrics.

## Files & Purpose

### `anti_fingerprint_inject.js`
JS injected via Playwright `add_init_script`.  
Overrides/patches:
- `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toDataURL` (can extend to `toBlob` / `getImageData`)  
- `WebGLRenderingContext.prototype.readPixels` (sparse perturbations)  
- `AnalyserNode.getFloatTimeDomainData` (tiny audio noise)  

Uses a deterministic PRNG (xorshift) and configurable amplitude (**EPS**) and pixel count.

### `shadow_puppeteer.py`
- Launches Chromium, collects a fingerprint snapshot via a JS snippet (FINGERPRINT_JS)  
- Relaunches with `anti_fingerprint.js` added as an init script and collects a second snapshot  
- Writes a JSON file with pre and post snapshots  

### `evaluate.py`
- Loads the JSON and computes:
  - `ua_sim`, `platform_sim`, `plugin_diff`, `canvas_sim`, `gpu_sim`  
- Produces a composite weighted score  

---

## Command-line Usage
```bash
python shadow_puppeteer.py --target <URL> --out <FILE>
# Use --no-headless to run with visible browser
python shadow_puppeteer.py --target <URL> --out snaps.json --no-headless

python evaluate.py <SNAPS_JSON>
```

---

## Interpreting Metrics (Plain English)

- **canvas_sim (0..1)**: similarity of canvas image before vs after. *Lower = more change*.  
- **gpu_sim**: whether reported WebGL renderer string changed (1 = same, 0 = different).  
- **composite (0..1)**: weighted aggregate of all signals. *1 = unchanged; closer to 0 = altered fingerprint*.  

**Rule-of-thumb targets:**
- `canvas_sim < 0.5` — good canvas disruption  
- `composite < 0.6` — meaningful reduction across signals  

---

## Tuning & Experiments
Edit `anti_fingerprint.js`:

- **EPS** — pixel amplitude (default 2.0). Increase to 4–8 for stronger effect  
- **Perturbation loop count** (default 64). Increase to 256 to touch more pixels  

Re-run `shadow_puppeteer.py` and `evaluate.py` after changes.  
Run multiple trials to get mean/stddev — fingerprints may vary slightly per run.

---

## Headed Runs & Visual Checks
Use `--no-headless` to visually inspect pages and ensure perturbations do not break UX:
```bash
python shadow_puppeteer.py --target <URL> --out snaps.json --no-headless
```

Also consider capturing screenshots before/after and computing SSIM to verify visual fidelity.

---

## Safety & Ethics
- Only run this on pages you own or have **explicit permission** to test  
- This tool is a **privacy defense research prototype** — do not use to evade lawful monitoring or for illegal purposes  
- Keep perturbations conservative on sites with critical canvas usage (e.g., online editors or games)  

---

## Next Steps (Suggested Enhancements)
- Add `run_many.py` to run N trials per target and aggregate results (mean/std) into CSV  
- Add CLI flags to `shadow_puppeteer.py` to parametrize EPS and pixel count without editing JS  
- Create a simple adversarial optimizer (hill-climb) to maximize canvas hash change with minimal visual impact  
- Convert the injector to a browser extension for easier end-user testing  
- Integrate FingerprintJS collector for more realistic fingerprint features  

---

## Troubleshooting
- **FileNotFoundError reading `anti_fingerprint.js`**: run `shadow_puppeteer.py` from project root or update script to use `Path(__file__).parent`  
- **Playwright errors launching browser**: run `playwright install` and ensure Chromium is installed  
- **Visual artifacts after increasing EPS**: reduce EPS or fewer perturbed pixels

## Example Output
```json
{
  "ua_sim": 1.0,
  "platform_sim": 1.0,
  "plugin_diff": 0,
  "canvas_sim": 0.455,
  "gpu_sim": 1.0,
  "composite": 0.782
}
```

### Interpretation:
Canvas was meaningfully changed (`canvas_sim = 0.455`) but the overall fingerprint still has many unchanged signals.
